### Questions:
1. What is the DOM?
2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
5. What is a component? 


1.) The DOM is the document object model which is a tree of nodes generated from the HTML that we can use in JS.

2.) An event is a event that occurs on the webpage

3.) An event listener will listen to the webpage and wait for an event to happen to trigger it.

4.) We would covert a node list into an array to use array properties the nodelist dont have.

5.) A component is a stand alone code that is a set of reusable logic.
